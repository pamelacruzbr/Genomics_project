#### Genomics studies project

I'm gathering in this repository useful functions for genomics data analysis. I have been following the Johns Hopkins University specialisation in Data science for genomics and the courses are being a source of inspiration for this project.

For now, here are the functionalities I have been added:

  1. FASTA File reading and pre-processing for the sequences.
  2. Gathering of main information about the sequences, such as GC percentage.
  3. There is also a function for generation of random DNA sequences for testing.

This is a simple project for now, new functionalities are about to come :D
