#### Genomics studies project

I'm gathering in this repository useful functions for genomics data analysis. I have been following the Johns Hopkins University specialisation in Data science for genomics and the courses are being a source of inspiration for this project.

For now, here are the functionalities I have been added:

  1. FASTA File reading and pre-processing for the sequences (Using Biopython or not - 2 scripts).
  2. Gather main information about the FASTA, such as entries and lengths.
  3. BLAST alignment script and processing of results.
  4. ORF Finder for a FASTA file and protein translation (in progress - Everyday I add more functionalities to this program)
